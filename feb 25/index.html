                <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> Engineering ethics are the principles that guide engineers to behave responsibly and ethically in their work. These ethics apply to the design and construction of systems and structures that impact people's lives, such as buildings, transportation, and energy.</p>
                <p style="letter-spacing: 5px;">Ethical violations can damage the reputation of engineers and their firms, and can lead to litigation and public safety risks. Engineers may also face conflicts of interest when their contractual obligations conflict with their ethical obligations.</p>

                <p style="text-decoration: underline red double;"> There are seven engineering ethics like honesty, integrity, promise-keeping, fidelity, fairness, respect for others, responsible citizenship, pursuit of excellence and accountability.The Golden Rule, or the rule of reciprocity, states that one should treat others as one would wish to be treated.</p>
                <p style="text-decoration: underline red double;"><del>An engineer is supposed to assess the risks of his experiments. The disasters do occur at times, though enough care is taken, as stated in the examples given in previous chapters. But knowing all the possibilities, if an engineer neglects the precautions, the results can be really disastrous.</del></p>

               <p style="padding:0 350px; font-size:22px;line-height: 2;"> With these norms or ethics, engineers can develop a sense of responsibility for society and the environment. They can learn to strike a balance between the competing demands of sustainability, safety, profitability and to put people's considerations and issues over short-term gains. </p>
